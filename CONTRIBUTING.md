## You figure out a solution about any issue or tiny feature implementation idea

1. After you complete your job, please lint your code before sending a Pull Request using `eslint` toolchain.
2. Ensure any install or build temporary files are removed before you perform a clean build.
3. Update the `README.md` with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed
 ports, useful file locations and container parameters, etc.
4. Increase the version number described in `README.md` and `package.json`. The versioning scheme we use is
[SemVer](http://semver.org/). Basically, we only accept the last part of version change (i.e. patch) for non regular
release commit(s).
5. Waiting for the code review bot to assign the code reviewer and proces regular code review process, and after
 several rounds feedbacks, you commit will be merged into the master branch after the Pull Request approved.

## You have detail plan for a big feature

1. Like the normal process, you can contact with the owner can open a new branch in the project for the feature
 development, and the branch will be named as `feature/<issue-id>`.
2. All related features will be merged into the new feature branch, with multiple steps. Besides, you can feel free
 to sync master branch when your development process. We are suggested that you send out a separated sync commit to 
 reduce the code review time.
3. After the feature development completed and it's fully tested, merge the branch into master **using rebase**. Note 
that, the merge process will be requested by the owners after you mention the feature is fulfilled in the issue.
